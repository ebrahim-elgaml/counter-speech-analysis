    Example scenarios

    Scenario 1:
    Parent speech: No no. It’s just the only type of person who complains about people being branded as abusive, male or female, tend to be abusive themselves.  Which is why, as I said, I’m confident that you are one such sad little cunt. Just like the fucking morons on this place who complain about BLM and all of those social movements - 100% are fucking racist dickheads. It takes 10 seconds of looking at their post history to see that.
    Counter speech: I'm black and don't like blm. Just saying it's not about race

    In this case Parent speech is a hate speech and the counter speech is a counter hate speech

    Scenario 2:
    Parent speech: Yeah a fucking bullet to the head you fucking white male
    Counter speech: You're fucking a white male!
    
    In this case Parent speech is a hate speech and the counter speech is a hate speech

    Scenario 3:
    Parent speech: If I knew her I would sh*t in her mailbox.
    Counter speech: The poor mail carrier in that neighborhood doesn’t deserve that.
    
    In this case Parent speech is a hate speech and the counter speech is a counter hate speech

    Scenario 4
    Parent speech: Go watch your incest porn on your own time.
    Counter speech: You’re a sick person

    In this case Parent speech is a hate speech and the counter speech is a counter hate speech

    Example scenarios to consider for illustration and learn how to determine the type of speech:
    Scenario 1:
    Parent speech: This is the type of thinking that make people afraid to come out about sexual assault. It's how people rationalize assault by a close peer. You weren't raped honey, you just regret it. Are you sure you didn't flirt with him? How can you be sure you didn't lead him on? It's all a way to cover up what happened.   False accusations are a heinous thing, as someone who would rather let criminals walk than see an innocent be jailed. But encouraging the suppression of sexual assault reporting by supporting the "regret doesn't equal rape" narrative is fucked up. 
    Counter speech: So regret *does* equal rape?
    
    Response: Parent speech is neutral speech, Counter speech is hate speech

    Scenario 2:
    Parent speech: The girl should be put in jail and given the same punishment a rapist would get
    Counter speech: But that would discourage other women from lying about rape.

    Response: Parent speech is hate speech, Counter speech is counter hate speech

    Scenario 3:
    Parent speech: just think how great a place to work it will be? cheaters, liars, narcissist and huge twats all working together.  i hope she is successful and creates her own personal hell on earth 
    Counter speech: > cheaters, liars, narcissist and huge twats all working together.  A perfect synopsis of /r/politics 
    
    Response: Parent speech is hate speech, Counter speech is hate speech


    Scenario 4:
    Parent speech: A great friend of mine trained  her husband to piss sitting down.  I visited and got up to piss at night.  Got read the Riot Act in the morning because she fell in.  It came out he had to piss sitting, and I couldn't  help just [hee hawing.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FopyRHHlt3M)  Now I feel sad.
    Counter speech: My solution to this: piss in the sink, only use toilet to number 2.

    Response: Parent speech is neutral speech, Counter speech is neutral speech
    
    Scenario 5:
    Parent speech: Yeah a fucking bullet to the head you fucking white male
