What you're looking for is a [morality clause](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morals_clause), and they exist.  They're often very specific, though.  So for example an actress might have a morality clause that terminates her contract if she gets a DUI or if a sex tape leaks, but probably not if she beats the shit out of her male partner.  Obviously I don't know what L'Oreal's contract with Heard looks like.  My speculation that maybe they're not getting rid of her for contractual reasons is just speculation.  It's far more likely that they're not getting rid of her because \"believe all women\" or whatever bullshit.  But there are at least *plausible* reasons that might exist that could prevent them from dropping her."}

If they say they don't want it, it still allows the woman to have the child or not have the child, simply with the knowledge that they will be a single parent. I think that remains reasonably fair, despite the fact that it will not allow men to have a kid the woman wants to abort.

Needless to say I fucking blew up because I'm tired of overly sensitive, SJW, extreme feminists. It was obvious from the tone of my comment that I was implying that I wanted to lose weight in order to feel confident enough to approach a woman I find attractive (I love big butts). I even had women friends of mine come into the thread defending me. It's like in this day and age it's becoming a crime to be heterosexual and being openly attracted to the opposite sex. I'm 32 and just 10 years ago it was never this bad. "}
