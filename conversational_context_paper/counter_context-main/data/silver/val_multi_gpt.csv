Feminism does care about the rights of men because feminism by definition cares about equal rights and opportunities for everyone.  This sub is an echo chamber of people fighting against a nonexistent subgroup of “femnazis”. No one is trying to put men in a cave so women can be supreme. The boogeyman isn’t real.   The people here lash out at feminism by rebranding feminism into something entirely different and then hating it. It’s an absurd false flag to help some people through some deep insecurities. It’s as ridiculous as telling someone you hate apples and you point out “look at those apples they are disgusting”, and then pointing to a table full of pumpkins.  You hate something, but it’s not feminism and you keep calling it feminism."
