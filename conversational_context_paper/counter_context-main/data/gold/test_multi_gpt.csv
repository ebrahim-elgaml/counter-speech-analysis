You are literally lopping off a part of a mans penis when you circumsize him. Now it may not have any major effect on their life. But its true. Its normalizing genitalia mutilation. Which also harms women because it being normalized means people start thinking its okay to do to women. Which its not. Because it can have a major effect on a womans life. Up to and including them not being able to have pleasure during sex.   So yes i do think circumsion (aka male genitalia mutilation) does have a negative impact on women.   I also think that circumsion its self needs to be reevaluated. There is no non religious reason as to why circumsion is necessary. And while typically it does no harm. That shouldn't be a reason to continue an ancient amd archaic practice.,you're a fucknut.
