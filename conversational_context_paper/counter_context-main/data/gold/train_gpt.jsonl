If women take the stairs more then why are more women obese than men???????  http://www.obesity.org/obesity/resources/facts-about-obesity/statistics  Seriously though, this analogy does nothing for me. I'm a man and always take the stairs next to the escalator because I like exercising.  And it's faster than not waiting behind a ton of people on a slow as balls escalator.  Edit: on second thought, maybe I could see this as the pink tax. I don't see a sign saying women can't take the escalator, it's just pink so it's assumed they must take the stairs?  Oh is this also supposed to highlight how an escalator is more dangerous than stairs? I can see that making sense too.", "original_target": "I walk up the escalator because its the fastest and most efficient way"}

It's a large factor in producing peadophiles, but there is no evidence to suggest it accounts for a large number of rapists as well.  Rape culture is more complicated than \"those guys were all raped as kids\", I would suggest that the societal pressures on guys to lose their virginity and to 'score' at a young age are huge factors in rape culture. And as an offshoot those same pressures produce society's like /r/braincels and people like Elliot Morgan.  If \"teaching men not to rape\" Translates to helping address those societal pressures, and teaching college students healthier attitudes about sex, Why not?", "original_target": "\"Nobody attempts any serious academic study of pedophilia?\"  Nah, it gets studied."}

Will Smith has Keanu Reeves vibes. He is a TV, music / rap, and movie star. While being clean, caring, and wholesome. Might be famous for meme TV and movies, but a legend of a person. He had mega famous top 10 hits rapping positivity and MIB, no sex, no sexual things. Wholesome rap music hitting top of the charts.  You gotta be fucking epic to be a wholesome mother fucker and hit top of the charts in a hardcore/gangsta genre. Fucking respect lol", "original_target": "No the will Smith rap it's pretty gay"}
