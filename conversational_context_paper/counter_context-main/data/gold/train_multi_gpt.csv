Now it may not have any major effect on their life. But its true. Its normalizing genitalia mutilation. Which also harms women because it being normalized means people start thinking its okay to do to women. Which its not. Because it can have a major effect on a womans life. Up to and including them not being able to have pleasure during sex.   So yes i do think circumsion (aka male genitalia mutilation) does have a negative impact on women.

The argument here is that women give men different standards based on how they look.   If this double standard applied to race, then you'd easily see the problem. If a woman wants men to not show overt sexual interest, then that has to apply to all men. Not just the ones they are attracted to, because a man has no clue whether she is attracted to them or not.   You can't have different standards on people based on how they look. Nobody would argue that it is okay to shame ugly women just because they're ugly, yet this doesn't apply to ugly men. That is the double standard that we're talking about here. Women are afforded special treatment just because they are women. ",Why can't you have different rules based on looks?

Of course it's his fault that she cheated. It's always the man's fault. If a woman doesn't satisfy a man in bed, too bad.

Now a common occurrence is you pay for everything, then she never contacts you again because she just wanted a free meal and didn't give a shit about you to begin with.  Women have jobs now, women are actually being paid more than men in our age range.
